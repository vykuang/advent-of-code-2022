# AoC 2022 Day 5 - Supply Stacks

Supplies are in marked crates, unloaded from ships. To get the ones we need, they have to be rearranged. A giant cargo crane moves crates between the stacks, so the desired crates come on the top.

Input: 

1. initial stacks of crates
```
    [D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3
 ```

1. rearrangement procedure

```
move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
```
